## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with administrative access
- Terraform v1.0 or higher
- Python 3.12.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- S3 bucket for Terraform state (manually created)
- virtualenv package manager

## Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation

1. **Create Terraform State Bucket:**

   ```bash
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket clickstream-tfstate --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waleadekoya/realtime-clickstream-lakehouse.git
   cd realtime-clickstream-lakehouse
   ```

3. **Setup Python Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. Terraform Deployment

1. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   cd infra/terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review the Plan:**

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="tfvars/dev.tfvars" -out="plan-dev.tfplan"
   ```

3. **Deploy the Infrastructure:**

   ```bash
   terraform apply "plan-dev.tfplan"
   ```

### 3. Web Application Setup

The website in the `website/` directory is automatically configured during deployment. The Terraform process:

1. Injects the API Gateway URL into the HTML template
2. Creates an `index.html` file from the `index.template.html`
3. Configures all necessary connection parameters

To use the demo website:

1. Navigate to the website directory:
   ```bash
   cd website/
   ```
2. Start a local Python server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the clickstream demo in action.

## Data Flow Explanation

1. **Event Generation:**
   - User interactions on the website generate click events
   - Events are sent to the API Gateway endpoint

2. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Lambda function processes incoming events
   - Events are placed into Kinesis Data Stream

3. **Stream Processing:**
   - AWS Glue job continuously reads from Kinesis
   - Data is transformed and enriched in real-time
   - Processed data is written in Delta Lake format to S3

4. **Data Storage:**
   - Data lands in the S3 bucket in Delta Lake format
   - Delta Lake ensures ACID properties and schema evolution
   - Data is available for querying via AWS Athena or other tools

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logs and Metrics

- **Lambda Logs:**
  ```bash
  aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/clickstream
  ```

- **Glue Job Metrics:**
  Monitor via AWS CloudWatch console or:
  ```bash
  aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/Glue --metric-name glue.driver.aggregate.numCompletedTasks
  ```

### Resource Management

The infrastructure includes cleanup helpers for proper resource termination:

- Network resources (ENIs, security groups) are automatically cleaned up
- Glue jobs are stopped during terraform `destroy`
- S3 objects are versioned for data protection

## Customization

### Environment Variables

Modify `infra/terraform/tvars/<env>.tfvars` files to customize:

- AWS region
- Project name and environment
- VPC and subnet configuration
- Glue worker configurations

### Adding Custom Processing

To extend the ETL process:

1. Modify `etl/glue_stream.py` to add custom processing logic
2. Update Lambda handler in `etl/handlers/click_handler.py` for preprocessing
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the changes

## Manual Workflow Dispatch

The `deploy` and `destroy` workflows can be triggered manually under **Actions → Deploy Clickstream Infrastructure** or **Destroy Infrastructure**. Provide:

- **Environment**: `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`
- **Action**: `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy`

### Example

To manually deploy the infrastructure:

1. Go to the GitHub Actions tab.
2. Select the `Deploy Clickstream Infrastructure` workflow.
3. Click `Run workflow` and provide the required inputs.
4. Monitor the workflow execution in the Actions tab.

## Resource Cleanup

To clean up the infrastructure and resources created by the pipeline, use the `Destroy Infrastructure` workflow. This workflow can be triggered manually and requires specifying the environment to destroy.

### Steps to Destroy Resources

1. Navigate to the GitHub Actions tab in the repository.
2. Select the `Destroy Infrastructure` workflow.
3. Click on `Run workflow` and choose the environment (`dev`, `staging`, or `prod`) to destroy.
4. Confirm the action to start the cleanup process.

The workflow uses Terraform to destroy all resources associated with the selected environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ENI Deletion Failures:**
   - The cleanup script addresses this, but you may need to manually delete ENIs if errors persist
   - Check the AWS console for orphaned ENIs in the VPC

2. **Glue Connectivity Issues:**
   - Verify the Glue connection via the AWS console
   - Check security group rules to ensure proper access

3. **API Access Problems:**
   - Verify CORS settings in the API Gateway
   - Check Lambda execution role permissions

### Workflow-Specific Issues

1. **OIDC Configuration Errors**:
   - Ensure the GitHub Actions role is correctly configured in AWS IAM.
   - Verify that the `id-token` permission is set to `write` in the workflow.

2. **Terraform Backend Errors**:
   - Check the S3 bucket used for the Terraform state.
   - Ensure the bucket exists and has the correct permissions.

3. **Input Parameter Issues**:
   - Verify that the correct environment and action inputs are provided when triggering workflows manually.
